# SkillBites — 99 Second Pitch Script

**Total time: ~90 seconds** (9 sec buffer for pauses/laughs)

---

## SLIDE 1 — TITLE (5 sec)

> "Hi, I'm [NAME]. I built SkillBites."

---

## SLIDE 2 — THE PROBLEM (20 sec)

> "Quick question — raise your hand if school taught you how to do your taxes."

*(pause, look around, nobody raises hand)*

> "How about negotiate your salary? Read a lease? Understand your 401k?"

> "We spent 12 years learning the Pythagorean theorem... but nobody taught us how to *adult*."

---

## SLIDE 3 — THE SOLUTION (20 sec)

> "SkillBites fixes that."

> "We have over 300 micro-courses on the practical stuff — taxes, salary negotiation, home buying, even 'what to do when your mind goes blank in a meeting.'"

> "Each course takes 10 minutes. Not 10 hours. *Ten minutes.*"

---

## SLIDE 4 — HOW IT WORKS (15 sec)

> "These are real courses people actually need."

*(gesture at slide)*

> "Every course has a lesson, a quiz, and a hands-on exercise."

> "You actually *learn* — not just watch a video and forget."

---

## SLIDE 5 — TRACTION (15 sec)

> "And this isn't just an idea. It's live. *Today.*"

> "300 courses. 18 hours of content. Full platform built."

> "And I have 400 more in the pipeline."

---

## SLIDE 6 — CTA (15 sec)

> "Take out your phone. Scan this QR code. Try a course right now."

*(pause to let people scan)*

> "SkillBites — learn the stuff school never taught you."

> "Thank you."

## TIPS FOR DELIVERY

1. **Start with the hand-raise question** — gets audience engaged immediately
2. **Pause after "nobody taught us how to adult"** — let it land, expect laughs
3. **Emphasize "TEN minutes"** — that's your differentiator
4. **"It's live" is your power move** — most pitchers have nothing built
5. **End with action** — QR code means they DO something, not just clap

## PRACTICE

- Time yourself 3x before you go on
- Record yourself once, watch it back
- The hand-raise question works — trust it

## Q&A PREP (4 minutes)

Likely questions:
- "How do you make money?" → Tiered pricing, $5-30, lifetime access
- "How do you make the courses?" → AI-assisted pipeline, human review
- "What's your background?" → [Your answer]
- "How do you get customers?" → SEO, social, the courses sell themselves
- "Competition?" → YouTube is unstructured, Udemy is 40 hours, we're 10 minutes
