# SkillBites — 99 Second Pitch Script

**Total time: ~95 seconds** (4 sec buffer)

---

## SLIDE 1 — TITLE (5 sec)

> "Hi, I'm [NAME]. I built **SkillBites**."

---

## SLIDE 2 — THE PROBLEM (15 sec)

> "Quick question — raise your hand if school taught you how to do your taxes."

*(pause, look around)*

> "How about negotiate your salary? Read a lease? Understand your 401k?"

> "We spent 12 years learning calculus... but nobody taught us how to **adult**."

---

## SLIDE 3 — THE LEARNING GAP (10 sec)

> "And the current options don't work."

> "Books? 300 pages for 3 insights. YouTube? 10 videos, still confused. Udemy? 40 hours for one skill."

> "People want to learn **one thing**, quickly, without the fluff."

---

## SLIDE 4 — THE SOLUTION (15 sec)

> "That's SkillBites."

> "Over **300 micro-courses** on the practical stuff — taxes, salary negotiation, insurance, even 'what to do when your mind goes blank in a meeting.'"

> "Each course? **10 minutes**. Not 10 hours. Ten minutes. With a quiz and exercise so you actually learn."

---

## SLIDE 5 — COURSE CLOUD (10 sec)

*(gesture at the courses)*

> "These are real courses people actually need. How to do your taxes. How to ask for a raise. How insurance works. AI without the hype."

---

## SLIDE 6 — PRICING (10 sec)

> "Simple pricing. One-time payment, lifetime access."

> "We have tracks for different life stages — $5 for life skills, $7 for college grads, all the way to $30 for everything."

> "No subscriptions. No upsells."

---

## SLIDE 7 — TRACTION (15 sec)

> "And this isn't just an idea. **It's live. Today.**"

> "300 courses published. 18 hours of content. Full platform built."

> "And I have 400 more in the pipeline."

---

## SLIDE 8 — CTA + QUESTIONS (15 sec)

> "Take out your phone. Scan this QR code. Try a course **right now**."

*(pause 3-4 sec to let people scan)*

> "SkillBites — learn the stuff school never taught you."

> "**Questions?**"

---

## DELIVERY TIPS

1. **Start with the hand-raise** — gets audience engaged immediately
2. **Pause after "nobody taught us how to adult"** — let it land, expect laughs
3. **Emphasize "TEN minutes"** — that's your differentiator
4. **"It's live TODAY" is your power move** — most pitchers have nothing built
5. **End with action** — QR code means they DO something, not just clap
6. **Say "Questions?" then STOP** — silence is confident

## Q&A PREP (use bonus slides 9-11)

**"How do you make money?"**
> "Tiered pricing — $5 to $30, one-time lifetime access. No subscriptions."

**"How do you make the courses?"**
> "AI-assisted pipeline with human review. That's how we scaled to 300 so fast."

**"What's your background?"**
> [Your answer]

**"How do you get customers?"**
> "SEO on high-intent searches like 'how to do taxes' plus social. The courses practically sell themselves."

**"Competition?"**
> "YouTube is unstructured — you watch 10 videos and you're still confused. Udemy is 40 hours. We're 10 minutes with an actual exercise. That's the niche."

**"What's next?"**
> "500 courses by Q2, then enterprise — corporate training is a massive market."
